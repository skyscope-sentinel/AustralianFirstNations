# The Australian First Nations Landlord & Economic Sovereignty Act

## 📜 Manifesto for Rightful Recognition
This repository serves as the foundation for a national petition and legislative framework to transition the relationship between the Australian Commonwealth and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from one of "welfare dependency" to one of **Rightful Landlord Status**.

For too long, First Nations peoples have been "tagged and tracked" by a system built on the displacement of their ancestors. We assert that sovereignty was never ceded. Therefore, the occupation of this continent and the extraction of its commodities constitute a contractual obligation. This petition demands the immediate formalization of **National Land Rent** and **Commodity Royalties** paid to the original custodians.

## 🏛️ Formal Petition to the Parliament of Australia

**To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives:**

This petition of concerned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the ongoing failure to legally and financially recognize the **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples** as the original and continuing owners (Landlords) of the Australian continent.

### The Grievance
1. **Unceded Sovereignty:** The legal fiction of *Terra Nullius* was overturned in *Mabo v Queensland (No 2)*, yet the economic implications of this ruling remain unfulfilled. 
2. **Systemic Exclusion:** Current "Aboriginal Services" function as bureaucratic oversight rather than the honoring of a debt. First Nations people are treated as "clients" of the state rather than the rightful owners of the estate.
3. **Economic Injustice:** The Australian Treasury benefits from land rates and natural commodities extracted from unceded lands without paying a fair rental or royalty return to the First Nations Traditional Owners.

### The Request
We therefore ask the House to legislate a **First Nations Economic Sovereignty Framework** that achieves the following:

1.  **Recognition of Landlord Status:** Formally acknowledge First Nations Elders and traditional owners as the "Lords of the Soil" with an inherent right to land rent.
2.  **Statutory Land Rent:** Direct the Treasury to implement a mandatory "Landlord Rate" on all Australian land holdings, to be paid directly into independent First Nations Community Trusts.
3.  **Commodity Royalty Redirection:** Legislate that 30% of all national revenue derived from natural commodities (mining, water, and gas) be redirected to the original custodians as a "Resource Rent."
4.  **Full Appropriation Autonomy:** Ensure that the budgeting, handling, and distribution of these funds are managed **entirely** by Aboriginal-led organizations and Elders, free from government oversight, interference, or "tagging."

## ⚖️ Legal & Constitutional Frameworks

This petition is underpinned by the following legal pillars:

| Pillar | Legal Basis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Common Law** | *Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992]* - Recognition that Native Title exists and the land was never empty. |
| **Precedent** | *Timber Creek [2019]* - The High Court's recognition of the right to compensation for economic and spiritual loss. |
| **Constitutional** | *Section 51(xxvi)* - The Parliament’s power to make laws for the benefit of the Aboriginal race. |
| **Natural Law** | The inherent right of a people to the wealth generated by their ancestral lands. |

This movement is not seeking "privilege" or "welfare." It is seeking the settlement of a historical and ongoing debt. We recognize the "rightful right" of the First Nations peoples to be the primary beneficiaries of the Australian continent's prosperity.
